SO! I made a thing and it's cute and I like it. Nothing too fancy. 

Couple of things - you can enter 4 characters in the 'enter temperature' box INCLUDING a '-' for negative numbers. This means you not enter a number smaller than -999. Sorry. 

When a result is freezing, you will see some cooooold emojis!
Conversely, when a result is boiling, you will see hot emojis! How cute!

If you click 'Convert' without selecting one of the radio buttons, you get an alert. It's a bit rude. Sorry.
